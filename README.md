[//]: # (This is a terminal based app written in Java to desmonstrate the application of Dijkstra and A* algorithms in finding the best route in a graph. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- First all the vantage places and their relative distances on the campus are modelled in a graph.)

[//]: # (- The graph is representred in the program using adjancency list.)

[//]: # (- The distances among the various places were precomputed using Google Map API.)

[//]: # (- Dijstrak's algorithm was used to find the best route based on distances.)

[//]: # (- A* algorithm was used to find the best route based on time.)
